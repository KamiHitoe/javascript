# ESLint

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs

- ESLint uses Espree for JS parsing
- ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code
- ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime

# yarn
yarn add eslint --dev
```

## init
